 * Description: The behavioral expectancies of the Fork System call.
 */


We will be testing input output behavior in accordance to the following
function definition.

Function Signature:
    int Fork(void *func_ptr, char *name, int name_size);

Parameters:
void *func_ptr  A pointer to the function that will be executed in
                a new thread. This address must be non-zero, 
                non-negative, and lie in the address space of
                the caller.

char *name      Will be used to name the forked thread. If the string
                literal "DEFAULT" is passed in, the name will default
                to [process name]-thread[thread_id]. The supplied 
                char pointer must be non-zero, non-negative, and lie 
                in the address space of the caller.

int name_size   The size of the name string not including the null
                terminator. This value must be non-zero, and non-negative.

Return Value
    int         If non-negative, it is the thread id of the newly forked thread.
                Otherwise the error codes are as follows
                -1  invalid user input
                -2  max process threads allocated
